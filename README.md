## IN PROGRESS

The project is still being developed. 

Things to come:
- Proper header that allows user to change between different API endpoints
- Fixed floating Back and Next buttons
- Proper Like / Upvote CTA button + Hide CTA button
- Loading screen when the data is being loaded + possibly skeletons
- Proper Unit Tests
- Optional : Light / Dark mode? / Refresh Button for the user

Added functionalities:
- Pagination works (button is currently quite hidden at the bottom of the page, but it works)
- Correctly sorted and indexed
- Date hover provides full information about the exact date and time of submission
- Clicking on user name navigates to the user's profile
