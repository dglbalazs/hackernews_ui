## STATUS:

Things to come:
- Proper Like / Upvote CTA button + Hide CTA button
- Proper Unit Tests
- Optional : Light / Dark mode? / Refresh Button for the user

Added functionalities:
- Data is fetched from the endpoints and is being rendered, 10 stories / page
- Header that allows user to change between different API endpoints
- Pagination
- Correctly sorted and indexed
- Loading screen when the data is being loaded
- Date hover provides full information about the exact date and time of submission
- Clicking on user name navigates to the user's profile
- API endpoints are stored in a separate file, so in case of Static Build we won't need to re-build the project, just substitute the .json file in the asset folder
- Separate file for functions and types for reusability
